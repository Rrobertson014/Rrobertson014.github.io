Data used to manage game components
    - the board
    - middle line
    - scoreboard
        > points (increase when it hits platform)
    - left platform
        > positionX (does not change)
        > positionY (user controlled)
        > speedY (user controlled vertical movement)
    - right platform
        > positionX (does not change)
        > positionY (user controlled)
        > speedY (user controlled vertical movement)
    - ball
        > positionX (constant motion, inverted when it hits either platforms)
        > positionY (constant motion, random when it hits a platform)
        > speedX
            + makes ball move left and right
            + increased when it hits a platform
        > speedY
            + moves the ball up and down

Events/Logic
    - start with SPACE ... starting keydown event
        > when spacebar is pressed, start the game
    - move platforms with ARROWS (holding key down)
        > holding Up Arrow moves the left platform Up
        > holding Down Arrow moves the left platform Down
    - when the BALL touches the LEFT platform
        > increase point value by 1
        > increase speed of the ball
        > send the ball in the opposite x direction
        > send the ball in a random y direction
    - when the BALL touches the TOP of the page
        > make speedY positive (send ball downwards)
    - when the BALL touches the BOTTOM of the page
        > make speedY negative (send ball upwards)
    - when BALL goes OFF screen
        > set positionX and positionY to the center of the page.
